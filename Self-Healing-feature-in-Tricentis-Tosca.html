    <h2>What is the Self Healing Feature?</h2>
    <p>
      The Self Healing feature in Tricentis Tosca is designed to automatically detect and correct broken or outdated test steps caused by changes in the application under test. This reduces maintenance effort and ensures that automated test cases remain reliable even when the UI or underlying application evolves.

    <h2>How Self Healing Works</h2>
    <p>
      Self Healing leverages intelligent algorithms to analyze failed test steps and match them with the most likely correct elements in the application. The workflow generally includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Detecting broken test steps during execution.</li>
      <li>Matching broken steps to updated or changed UI elements.</li>
      <li>Automatically updating the test case or suggesting corrections.</li>
      <li>Logging changes for transparency and review.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By automating the maintenance of test scripts, Self Healing greatly improves test efficiency and reduces manual intervention.
