    <h2>What is Tosca Commander?</h2>
    <p>
      Tosca Commander is the graphical user interface of the Tricentis Tosca TestSuite, and serves as the primary environment for test-case design, execution, and reporting. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
    </p>
    <p>
      With Tosca Commander you can create and manage your workspace, design modules automatically by scanning the application under test, build test cases, execute them, and analyse results — all from one screen. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Features & Benefits</h2>
    <p>Some of the standout features of Tosca Commander include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Model-based, codeless automation — reduces or eliminates scripting for many test scenarios. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</li>
      <li>Support for multiple testing types including UI, API, mobile and integration testing. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</li>
      <li>A unified test management environment — requirements, test-cases, execution, reporting in one tool. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</li>
      <li>Easy navigation and intuitive interface — modules, test-cases, execution lists are structured in tree layouts and drag-and-drop. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These make Tosca Commander particularly well suited for teams who want a robust automation platform without deep scripting overhead, or need enterprise-scale test coverage across varied technologies.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Core Components & Workflow</h2>
    <p>The general workflow in Tosca Commander includes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Creating or opening a **workspace** — either a single-user or multi-user repository. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</li>
      <li>**Scanning** the application under test (AUT) to build modules — for example using the XScan engine. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}</li>
      <li>Designing test cases and test data in modules and hierarchies — modules ↔ test steps ↔ test case designs. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}</li>
      <li>Executing the tests and reviewing results — via execution lists, logs and reporting. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}</li>
      <li>Maintaining, versioning and updating as part of the lifecycle — especially for multi-user or large scale projects. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In short, Tosca Commander acts as the central hub of the Tosca tool-chain.
